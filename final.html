			<h3>Apple pays less</h3>

<p>Nowadays money flows in and out of massive firms in the blink of an eye. This is most prevalent at the largest of tech companies, dominating markets through a wide reach of goods and services. <br></br>Apple and Google are prime examples, and while they each have massive market caps, the amount of taxes they pay differs. Examination into their policies and payments outlines some stark differences over the years and sheds some light on their ongoing practices.<br></br>Apple has mastered a variety of evasion strategies that bend the rules as much as possible without breaking the law. By utilizing Tax Haven countries, they make sure to keep income into the United States as low as possible, to avoid high fiscal tax rates.<br></br>Cork, Ireland represents one of these places, where a longstanding Apple corporate instillation receives all of Apple’s revenue from Europe, India, and the Middle East, according to business analysts and reporters Damini Bhandary and Akash Kushwaha. This means they pay taxes at Ireland’s rate, a longstanding one that has been arranged between the firm and the government.<br></br>The struggles with enforcing one nation’s tax laws on a global company with the size and reach of Apple show clearly in payment trends, with their Gross Income increasing by 85.8% from 2017 to 2022, and their tax provisions only rising by 22.6%.<br></br>This disproportionate trend is not shared by google, whose income has decreased by 47.8% and paid 24.5% less taxes, showing a much more balanced ratio when it comes to allotment for taxes.<br></br>The use of two subsidiary companies, Apple Operations Europe and Apple Sales International, both based in Ireland, ensure that they pay the local 12.5% tax rate instead of the United States 21%. This practice may be shady, but it falls within the scope of the law and is not uncommon amongst major international firms.</p>

			<h3>The lines dont match</h3>
			<p>We can see that income even in the United States keeps rising and is quickly leaving any sense of proportionality behind in tax payments. Apple have managed to keep their domestic tax rates very much in check and while Google still does not pay the 21% the Government wishes they could get their hands on, ceasing controversial oversees haven usage has at least evened out their runaway profits. </p>

	<p> According to Zoe Schiffer for the verge, they stopped moving money from Ireland to the Netherlands to Bermuda after 2020, a move that let them pocket 23 billion in 2017 alone.  Google’s change in practices came amongst backlash over these shady practices.<br></br>We can observe at least some favoring for more above board practices, as their profits and tax provisions seem to follow each other in proportion.

			<h3>Is everything there?</h3>
			<p>It’s quite hard to know whether these firms are making changes, as international mega-companies are impossible to regulate for most governments. The US earnestly tries, but with many like Apple relying on subsidiaries and foreign tax loopholes, it remains difficult to see if their efforts hold beyond domestically.<br></br>The government is hopeful that going forward many United States based companies will contribute more to this nations tax income, but its hard to tell if that will come to fruition.
